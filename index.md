# Monuments and Memorials

## Project Description

<span style="color: #1a82ef">Monuments and Memorials in the Age of #TakeItDown</span> is an effort to develop a cohesive database and Content Management System (CMS) for at least 700 already collected monument and memorial records. The vision for this project is to have the CMS provide access to credible information about monuments and memorials. Furthermore, the system should display and filter these records in an easy-to-navigate and searchable manner. Some features that the system shall provide include: adding new data to the system through manual entry or CSV upload, associating an image with each record, integrating GPS coordinates with records to create useful visualization of data overlaid on a map, and creating a personal account for access to more features. The goal is to make this data widely accessible to the public to view, update, and download via a website.
