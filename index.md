# Monuments and Memorials

## Project Description

<span style="color: #1a82ef">Monuments and Memorials in the Age of #TakeItDown</span> is an effort to develop a cohesive database and Content Management System (CMS) for at least 700 already collected monument and memorial records. The vision for this project is to have the CMS provide access to credible information about monuments and memorials. Furthermore, the system should display and filter these records in an easy-to-navigate and searchable manner. Some main features of the system include: the ability to add new data to the system in a few different ways (manual entry or CSV upload), the ability to associate an image with each record, the integration of GPS coordinates for each record to create useful visualization of data overlaid on a map, and the ability to tag records to allow users to group them in various ways. The goal is to make this data widely accessible to the public to view and update via a website.
