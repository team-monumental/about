# Monuments and Memorials

## Project Description

<span style="color: #1a82ef">Monuments and Memorials in the Age of #TakeItDown</span> is an effort to develop a cohesive database and Content Management System (CMS) for at least 700 already collected monuments and memorial records. The vision for this project is to have the CMS provide access to credible information about monuments and memorials. Furthermore, the system should display and filter the data in an easy to use and searchable manner. Some features of the system include: the ability to add new data to the system in a few different ways (manual entry or CSV upload), associating an image with each record, integration of GPS coordinates for each record to create useful visualization of data overlaid on a map, and tagging of records to allow users to group them. The goal is to make this data widely accessible to the public to view and update, continuously improving the information available.
